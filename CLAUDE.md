# Development Rules for Learn X in Y Minutes

## Git Commit Guidelines
- **NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages**
- **NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" or similar phrases**
- **NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar attribution**
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why, without mentioning AI assistance

## Project Structure
- All tutorials are markdown files in the `docs/` directory
- Each tutorial should be named `[topic].md` (e.g., `gitflow.md`, `python.md`)
- Tutorial titles should follow the format: "Learn [Topic] in Y Minutes"

## README Maintenance
- The README.md should list all tutorials in alphabetical order
- Each tutorial should be a bullet point with a link to the markdown file
- Format: `* [Learn Topic in Y Minutes](docs/topic.md)`
- Keep the list alphabetically sorted for easy navigation
